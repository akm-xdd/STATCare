## Problem Statement

After our active ground research and software reviews we noticed that in advanced hospitals like AIIMS Trauma Center in Delhi, doctors face challenges due to limited access to real-time patient vitals and location across various departments. These include:

- Long emergency delay times cause preventable harm and deaths.
- Lack of real-time coordination and monitoring across departments.

## Our Solution

By equipping patients with RFID tags storing unique IDs, we enable real-time location tracking as patients move between departments, improving communication and coordination.

Once the patient is discharged, their data is stored corresponding to their respective UHID. This can help in future medical treatments of the person as this data will be available to the hospitals.

In a long run such large dataset can be trained to automate the treatment process based on parameters such as medication, response to drugs etc.
